# Airbnb-ML-Price-Prediction

This report was one of the sections from a larger group project that I undertook in my DATA1902 (Informatics & Data Computation) unit. In essence, our goal in this report was to produce price prediction functions using Airbnb accommodation features as input, with simple machine-learning algorithms from Python's scikit-learn library.

Since we decided to take it a step further by incorporating "feature-engineering" (pre-processing of data set features before churning it through an ML algorithm) and "cross-validation" (dividing up train & test data in different ways and then averaging the results of each way), I modularised the process by creating "template functions" that could be customised and fit together very easily, kind of like a jigsaw puzzle.
